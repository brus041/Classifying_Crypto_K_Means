# Unsupervised_Learning

Used K-Means Clustering to group cryptocurrencies based on their characteristics in the market.

Process included first processesing the original data, scaling the data, and creating a dummies data-set. 

The next steps were using PCA and then t-SNE to reduce the dimensions of our data and finally apply a K-Means clustering classifier. 

Next an elbow curve was used to determine the optimal amount of clusters. After an optimal k was found, the clusters were labeled using a "predict" function.
